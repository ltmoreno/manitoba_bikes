With a comfortable, capable off-road design, the 6061 aluminum frame is off-road worthy, and capable of leading a double life on city streets and park paths. Designed with our holistic approach to fit and geometry, the Storm 5’s longer reach, slacker head tube angle and steep seat tube angle provides more powerful, efficient pedaling, increased climbing traction and added grip and control when descending.

Complementing its 100mm of SR Suntour XCE28 fork travel is a solid, reliable Shimano Tourney EZ-Fire 21 speed drivetrain, so you can always find the right gear and spend less time at the shop. The mechanical disc brakes provide controllable power for confident, safe stops on and off of the road.

Progressive Design
- The Storm uses Norco's holistic approach to fit and geometry to achieve its nimble, confident trail performance. The unique combination of longer reach, slacker head tube angle and steep seat tube angle provides a more forward weight distribution within a longer wheelbase. This allows more powerful, efficient pedaling, increased climbing traction and added grip and control when descending to help make the most of every ride.

- Each Storm features 100mm of front suspension travel – the perfect amount for off-road adventure and exploration, without feeling like you're carrying around extra weight or bulk when you don't need it.

Internal Routing For Shifter and Brake Cables
- By routing the brake and shift cables inside the frames, they are out of harm's way and away from the elements. That means shifting and braking performance last longer between services, and the bikes look clean!

- Depending on what frame size you ride, the Storm is available in a wheel size to suit you. The XS, and S are equipped with 27.5"" tires to help fit smaller riders, and the L and XL feature 29"" wheels so taller riders can take advantage of their smooth ride.

The Revolver FS 120 benefits from the same stiff, lightweight chassis, but is specially-designed with a longer stroke rear shock and 120mm XC fork – creating a geometry specifically designed for larger than life rides where you don't have the time to pick the smoothest line – because there's a finish line to cross – in reality or your imagination.

- Full Carbon 120mm Frame - 12x148mm
- Marathon Geometry with Gravity Tune
- Custom Tuned RockShox Rear Suspension
- Ride Aligned
- New RockShox SID Select+ 120mm Fork w/35mm Stanchions
- New RockShox SIDLuxe Select+ Custom Tuned Rear Shock
- Custom Norco Dropper lever
- Tubeless ready w/Stan's tape, valves and sealant
- SRAM G2 R 4 Piston Brakes

RIDER BENEFITS:
- POWER TO THE WIN: The Revolver FS's Ride Aligned XC design features a low, forward riding position for powerful, efficient pedaling, maximum traction, and a front end that stays on the ground when the going gets steep, so you're in control of where you go, and how fast you get there.
- REDUCED FATIGUE: Shifting the rider's center of gravity for optimum weight distribution within the Revolver FS 100's wheelbase, riders are able to navigate every aspect of a race course from an optimal position. The fine-tuned Ride Aligned XC design provides increased grip and support when the rider is seated and powering through undulating terrain, which greatly-reduces fatigue by minimizing the need for weight shifts throughout the race.
- STIFFER, FASTER FRAME CONSTRUCTION: The Revolver FS has been designed with a fine-tuned carbon frame to optimize pedaling efficiency. We engineered the downtube, bottom bracket and chainstay junctions to provide a 40% increase in axial rigidity, ensuring every available Watt you throw down is translated into forward motion.
- OPTIMIZED SUSPENSION DESIGN: The Revolver FS is designed to excel on a wide variety of terrain. The Ride Aligned suspension kinematics maintain incredible traction both climbing and descending and provides an efficient pedaling platform without having to reach for a lockout, while tracking precisely through rough descents. By employing the Ride Aligned Bike Setup App, your suspension sets up quickly and precisely.
- UNCOMPROMISED DESCENTS: In addition to the pedaling prowess of the new Revolver FS, we wanted to be sure it would charge descents – not just survive them. So, we designed the FS 100 with a 68.5 degree head angle and a 60mm stem. The 120 is a degree slacker which, when combined with the Revolver chassis' frame stiffness, 120mm dropper post and 2.35"" tires, provides a level of precision and confidence on descents that will leave competitors in your wake.",https://www.sefiles.net/images/library/large/norco-revolver-fs-2-120-384094-1.png
